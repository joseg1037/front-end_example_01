# front-end_example_01
This is a simple front-end example of a stopwatch using html, css and javascript (mixing the debounce() method brought from node.js); its idea is to have a simple but responsive and functional design using flexbox so it would adapt to different page sizes including mobile devices
Note 01* Depending on the browser and device, a difference on the section for milliseconds could be noticed making it sometimes slower than on a computer or on another browser
