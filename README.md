# front-end_example_01
This is a simple front-end example of a timer using html, css and javascript; its idea is to have a simple but responsive and functional design using flexbox so it would adapt to different page sizes including mobile devices
Note 01* Because of javascript being slower on mobile devices than computers, the stopwatch would be then slower on a tablet or cellphone
